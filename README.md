The folder contains all the necessary scripts to use the Schultz Cigarette Burn Toolbox for measuring video framerates and onset times.

The Schultz Cigarette Burn Toolbox is a series of Python, MATLAB, and Arduino scripts designed to measure veridical video framerates and onset times. It uses visual markers (“Cigarette Burns”) on the corners of the screen which can be synchronized with EEG and/or response data using an analog input box or an Arduino microcontroller (or similar). The hardware setup and original tests are described in the manuscript published in the Journal of Neuroscience Methods:
